# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe

## 📌 Overview
This project implements real-time hand gesture recognition using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**. It detects hand landmarks from a webcam feed and classifies gestures such as:
- 👍 Thumbs Up  
- 👎 Thumbs Down  
- 👌 OK Sign

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

### ✅ Install Required Libraries
Ensure you're using **Python 3.8.10** as MediaPipe has compatibility issues with newer versions.

- Python – 3.8.10  
- OpenCV – 4.5  
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
## 🧠 How MediaPipe Works
MediaPipe provides efficient hand tracking using deep learning models. It:

- Detects hand regions in the frame.

- Extracts 21 key landmarks per hand.

- Normalizes coordinates to the frame size.

- Uses landmark positions to recognize gestures.

## 📈 Model Summary


## 🧾 Conclusion
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
You can extend it further by:

-✋ Adding more gesture classifications

-🧠 Integrating with AR/VR applications

-🏠 Enabling smart home control

-🎮 Enhancing interactivity in games
